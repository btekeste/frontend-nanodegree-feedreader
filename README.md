## Overview
This project is a web-based application that displays RSS feeds and provides a test report. My contribution was to build the test report according to requirements for a standard RSS feed reader.

## Instructions
This application imports all the required APIs at runtime such as [Jasmine 3.3](http://jasmine.github.io/) for testing and [Handlebars 4.0.12](https://handlebarsjs.com/) for semantic templates.
In order to launch the app, you just need to clone the repo and open the index.html file with your web browser. Look into the js/app.js file to modify URLs for the feeds. To make changes to the Jasmine test report, go to jasmine/spec/feedreader.js.

## Contributing
This project was [forked](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader) from Udacity Front-End program and evaluated by Udacity code reviewers.
Feel free to send me pull requests or fork my repo if you interested in extending my version of the RSS Feed Reader.
